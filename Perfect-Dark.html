            <b>Perfect Dark</b> is a first-person shooter developed by Rare and released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in 2000. It is the first game of the Perfect Dark series and follows Joanna Dark, an agent of the Carrington Institute
            research centre, as she attempts to stop an extraterrestrial conspiracy by rival corporation dataDyne. The game features a campaign mode where a single player must complete a series of levels under certain difficulty settings to progress
            through the story. It also features a range of multiplayer options, including a co-operative mode and traditional deathmatch settings with computer-controlled bots.

            As a spiritual successor to Rare's 1997 first-person shooter GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark shares many features with its predecessor and runs on an upgraded version of its engine. GoldenEye 007 director Martin Hollis led the game's
            production
            for
            the first 14 months of its near three-year development cycle before he left Rare to pursue other interests. The game is technically one of the most advanced titles for the Nintendo 64 and requires an Expansion Pak to access the campaign
            mode
            and most of the multiplayer features. Shortly before the game's release, a feature that would have allowed players to place a photograph of their choice onto the face of their multiplayer character was cut due to sensitive issues
            surrounding
            the ability for players to attack images of real people.

          <h4> <a id="GameplayContent"></a>Gameplay</h4>
          <p>Perfect Dark is a first-person shooter where players must complete levels to unlock content and progress through the game's storyline.[1] Players manoeuvre their character from a first-person perspective and have the ability to lean left
            or right, look up or down, crouch, crawl, and drop from most ledges.[2] However, there is no jump ability.[3] Interaction with the environment is via a single context-sensitive button, which can activate computers, operate lifts, and open
            doors.[2] Players can carry an unlimited number of weapons, ranging from handguns to assault rifles, rocket launchers, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, and combat knives.[4] Besides their primary mode of fire, weapons have a secondary function
            that enables an alternate fire mode or grants players special abilities.[3] For example, the secondary function of the K7 Avenger assault rifle detects threats like explosive devices.[4] Most weapons have a finite magazine and must be
            reloaded after a certain number of shots.[2] Some can also be used in duplicate, one in each hand.[4]</p>

        <article>
          <h4>Multiplayer</h4>
          <p>Perfect Dark features a deathmatch multiplayer mode where up to four players and eight computer-controlled bots can compete against each other in several arenas.[13] Again, a split-screen is used if more than one player are playing
            simultaneously. Players start a game unarmed and with a certain amount of health. Weapons and ammunition are placed around the arena in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are regenerated elsewhere in the arena, once again
            unarmed. The overall objective of each game is determined by the scenario being played.[14] Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode, where players score points by killing opponents, to objective-based games such as Capture
            the
            Flag and King of the Hill.[14] Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase, where players must take a briefcase and survive with it for as long as possible, and Hacker Central, a game type where players score points by hacking a computer
            system using a data uplink device.[14]

            Aspects of a deathmatch game can be highly customised,[15] including the chosen arena, the winning conditions, and the ability to choose what weapons and items appear where in the arena.[14] Players can also be grouped into teams or
            compete
            individually, and they can optionally be shown coloured according to their team.[14] The appearance, team affiliation, skill level and pre-set behaviours of each computer-controlled bot can be customised.[14] Pre-set behaviours range from
            them pursuing the highest-scoring player to exclusively chasing the player who killed them last. Other behaviours restrict bots to only attack players using fists and disarming moves.[14] On higher skill levels, bots perform actions at a
            superhuman level.[14] Players may also issue commands to bots of their team to perform certain tasks. For example, a player can order an allied bot to defend an area or attack a designated opponent.[14]

            The multiplayer mode includes 30 pre-set challenges against bots that may be tackled by one or more players.[14] These challenges cover a variety of game types, weapon arrangements, and level setups.[3] By completing challenges,
            additional
            features such as new weapons, player models, and bot behaviours are unlocked.[14][16] At the end of a match, the overall results are shown, alongside information about the individual players' performance. The game keeps track of player
            statistics such as damage dealt and distance travelled, and awards players with medals based on how well they performed.[16] Players are also ranked according to their performance; the better the performance, the higher the grade.[17] The
            player's overall progress, multiplayer setups, and character profiles can be saved to the Nintendo 64 game cartridge or a Controller Pak.[12][17] The game also supports the Rumble Pak.[1]</p>

          <h4><a id="PlotContent">Plot</h4>
          <p>Perfect Dark is set in 2023 against the backdrop of an interstellar war between two alien races:[18] the Maians, who resemble the archetypal Grey alien, and the Skedar, reptile-like creatures who use a cloaking device to appear as Nordic
            men. Using this device, they can interact with humans on Earth without appearing overly suspicious. Meanwhile, on Earth, there is an ongoing rivalry between two factions: The Carrington Institute, a research centre founded by Daniel
            Carrington that secretly operates an espionage group in league with the Maians, and dataDyne, a defence contractor corporation headed by Cassandra de Vries. In exchange for creating an AI capable of cracking an ancient alien spacecraft
            buried on the bed of the Pacific Ocean, the Skedar have agreed to supply dataDyne with enough alien technology to become the biggest corporation on Earth.[19]


            Joanna and Elvis follow dataDyne to the ancient spacecraft, where they find a reprogrammed Dr. Caroll cracking the weapon. Joanna replaces its current personality with a backup of the original, and the restored Dr. Carroll sets the weapon
            to self-destruct. As Carrington and Joanna prepare for a Presidential reception, the Skedar assault the Carrington Institute and capture Joanna. In space, aboard an alien spaceship on course to the Skedar homeworld, Joanna finds herself
            in
            a holding cell with Cassandra. Feeling that she has been used, Cassandra redeems herself by making a distraction and sacrificing herself, freeing Joanna and therefore giving herself a chance for revenge. With the help of Elvis, Joanna
            takes
            control of the spaceship and lands on the Skedar homeworld, where she ultimately defeats the Skedar leader, leaving the Skedar in disarray. The game ends with Elvis and Joanna leaving the planet just prior to an orbital bombardment from
            the
            Maian navy.[19]</p>

          <b>Concept and desgin</b>
          <p>
            Perfect Dark was developed by Rare and originally directed by Martin Hollis as a spiritual successor to the company's 1997 first-person shooter GoldenEye 007.[21][22] Shortly after GoldenEye 007 was released,[22] Rare was planning to work
            on a game based on the GoldenEye sequel Tomorrow Never Dies, but the company was outbid by Electronic Arts, which would release their video game adaptation in 1999.[23] The result did not affect the developers, who felt they had already
            spent too much time immersed in the James Bond universe.[23][24] Working titles for the game included "Covert Ops" and "Alien Intelligence" before the words "Perfect Dark" were decided on.[25] The word "Dark" was chosen for its
            association
            with the game's bleak focus on killing.[26] Hollis noted naming similarities to the 2006 first-person shooter Black by Criterion Games: "Game developers just like black, nihilism, dystopian futures, the number zero, infinity, spheres,
            perfection—all that kind of stuff."[26] The double slash symbol in the game's logo was inspired by the Japanese writing system,[27] while the bad grammar of the phrase "Perfect Dark" partially alludes to Hollis' affection for the way
            Japanese developers use English words in their own games and products.[24]</p>

        <article>
          <b>Production</b>
          <p>When production of the game started, the developers upgraded the GoldenEye 007 engine with new features and graphical enhancements such as real-time lighting and support for bigger environments and more textures.[28] According to Rare,
            only 30% of the original engine remained, providing a basic framework to construct levels and animate characters.[30] A new movement system was constructed, allowing players to fall off edges.[22] Other incremental improvements included
            better shattering glass effects, which would allow players to shoot out objects such as bottles of wine, and the inclusion of computer-controlled bots in multiplayer matches.[25] The artificial intelligence was improved so that opponents
            could "assess threats, work as a team and communicate with each other."[31] Opponents were given the ability to draw a secondary weapon when disarmed.[32] Death cries and more elaborate gore effects, which allow gunshots to disperse and
            stain enemies' blood onto nearby walls and objects, were also added.[33]</p>
