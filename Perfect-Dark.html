          <p>
            <b>Perfect Dark</b> is a first-person shooter developed by Rare and released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in 2000. It is the first game of the Perfect Dark series and follows Joanna Dark, an agent of the Carrington Institute
            research centre, as she attempts to stop an extraterrestrial conspiracy by rival corporation dataDyne. The game features a campaign mode where a single player must complete a series of levels under certain difficulty settings to progress
            through the story. It also features a range of multiplayer options, including a co-operative mode and traditional deathmatch settings with computer-controlled bots.

            As a spiritual successor to Rare's 1997 first-person shooter GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark shares many features with its predecessor and runs on an upgraded version of its engine. GoldenEye 007 director Martin Hollis led the game's
            production
            for
            the first 14 months of its near three-year development cycle before he left Rare to pursue other interests. The game is technically one of the most advanced titles for the Nintendo 64 and requires an Expansion Pak to access the campaign
            mode
            and most of the multiplayer features. Shortly before the game's release, a feature that would have allowed players to place a photograph of their choice onto the face of their multiplayer character was cut due to sensitive issues
            surrounding
            the ability for players to attack images of real people.

        <h4> <a id="GameplayContent"></a>Gameplay</h4>
        <p>Perfect Dark is a first-person shooter where players must complete levels to unlock content and progress through the game's storyline.[1] Players manoeuvre their character from a first-person perspective and have the ability to lean left
          or right, look up or down, crouch, crawl, and drop from most ledges.[2] However, there is no jump ability.[3] Interaction with the environment is via a single context-sensitive button, which can activate computers, operate lifts, and open
          doors.[2] Players can carry an unlimited number of weapons, ranging from handguns to assault rifles, rocket launchers, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, and combat knives.[4] Besides their primary mode of fire, weapons have a secondary function
          that enables an alternate fire mode or grants players special abilities.[3] For example, the secondary function of the K7 Avenger assault rifle detects threats like explosive devices.[4] Most weapons have a finite magazine and must be
          reloaded after a certain number of shots.[2] Some can also be used in duplicate, one in each hand.[4]</p>

        <details>
          <summary> <b><a id="CampaignContent"></a>Campaign</b></summary>
          <p>Perfect Dark features a campaign mode where a single player controls the game's protagonist, Joanna Dark, through a series of levels collected together into missions.[3] In each level, the player must complete a set of objectives while
            opponents controlled by the game's artificial intelligence try to hinder the player's progress.[8] Objectives generally require the recovery and use of high-tech gadgets like night-vision googles or door decoders.[3] The player has
            certain
            freedom as to how they want to approach encounters with opponents and many objectives can be completed in a nonlinear order.[9] Stealth is an important element of the gameplay because the player can kill opponents without being seen or
            remain undetected by using disguises.[2][3] If Joanna fails an objective or her health is fully depleted, the player must start the level again from the beginning.[8]

            Each level can be played on three distinct difficulty settings.[8] These affect aspects such as the number of objectives that must be completed, damage taken from opponents, the effectiveness of the game's optional aiming assistance, and
            the availability of ammunition and protective shields.[10] Four bonus levels may be unlocked by completing the campaign on each difficulty setting and all the challenges in the firing range.[11] Some of these bonus levels allow the player
            to assume the role of a different character.[3] If all the levels have been completed on the highest difficulty, an additional setting becomes available, allowing the player to customise various aspects of the game's opponents, such as
            their health, aiming accuracy, and the damage they inflict.[10] The player may also unlock cheats by completing levels within a certain time limit.[3]

            The campaign includes a co-operative mode, allowing two players, or one player and up to four computer-controlled bots, to tackle a level together.[8] If two players play, the game uses a split screen display, with the option to split
            horizontally or vertically.[12] Options such as friendly fire can be disabled and only one player is required to survive a level.[8] A "Counter-Operative" mode is also included, allowing one player to play a level as Joanna while another
            takes over the role of an opponent while attempting to stop her.[13] The player-controlled opponent has less health than Joanna but will reappear as another opponent when defeated. The opposing player may also choose to take control of
            another opponent at any time by swallowing a suicide pill.[8]</p>

        </details>


        <details>
          <summary> <b><a id="MultiplayerContent"></a>Multiplayer</b></summary>
          <p>Perfect Dark features a deathmatch multiplayer mode where up to four players and eight computer-controlled bots can compete against each other in several arenas.[13] Again, a split-screen is used if more than one player are playing
            simultaneously. Players start a game unarmed and with a certain amount of health. Weapons and ammunition are placed around the arena in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are regenerated elsewhere in the arena, once again
            unarmed. The overall objective of each game is determined by the scenario being played.[14] Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode, where players score points by killing opponents, to objective-based games such as Capture
            the
            Flag and King of the Hill.[14] Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase, where players must take a briefcase and survive with it for as long as possible, and Hacker Central, a game type where players score points by hacking a computer
            system using a data uplink device.[14]

            Aspects of a deathmatch game can be highly customised,[15] including the chosen arena, the winning conditions, and the ability to choose what weapons and items appear where in the arena.[14] Players can also be grouped into teams or
            compete
            individually, and they can optionally be shown coloured according to their team.[14] The appearance, team affiliation, skill level and pre-set behaviours of each computer-controlled bot can be customised.[14] Pre-set behaviours range from
            them pursuing the highest-scoring player to exclusively chasing the player who killed them last. Other behaviours restrict bots to only attack players using fists and disarming moves.[14] On higher skill levels, bots perform actions at a
            superhuman level.[14] Players may also issue commands to bots of their team to perform certain tasks. For example, a player can order an allied bot to defend an area or attack a designated opponent.[14]

            The multiplayer mode includes 30 pre-set challenges against bots that may be tackled by one or more players.[14] These challenges cover a variety of game types, weapon arrangements, and level setups.[3] By completing challenges,
            additional
            features such as new weapons, player models, and bot behaviours are unlocked.[14][16] At the end of a match, the overall results are shown, alongside information about the individual players' performance. The game keeps track of player
            statistics such as damage dealt and distance travelled, and awards players with medals based on how well they performed.[16] Players are also ranked according to their performance; the better the performance, the higher the grade.[17] The
            player's overall progress, multiplayer setups, and character profiles can be saved to the Nintendo 64 game cartridge or a Controller Pak.[12][17] The game also supports the Rumble Pak.[1]</p>

        <h4><a id="PlotContent">Plot</h4>
        <p>Perfect Dark is set in 2023 against the backdrop of an interstellar war between two alien races:[18] the Maians, who resemble the archetypal Grey alien, and the Skedar, reptile-like creatures who use a cloaking device to appear as Nordic
          men. Using this device, they can interact with humans on Earth without appearing overly suspicious. Meanwhile, on Earth, there is an ongoing rivalry between two factions: The Carrington Institute, a research centre founded by Daniel
          Carrington that secretly operates an espionage group in league with the Maians, and dataDyne, a defence contractor corporation headed by Cassandra de Vries. In exchange for creating an AI capable of cracking an ancient alien spacecraft
          buried on the bed of the Pacific Ocean, the Skedar have agreed to supply dataDyne with enough alien technology to become the biggest corporation on Earth.[19]


          Joanna and Elvis follow dataDyne to the ancient spacecraft, where they find a reprogrammed Dr. Caroll cracking the weapon. Joanna replaces its current personality with a backup of the original, and the restored Dr. Carroll sets the weapon
          to self-destruct. As Carrington and Joanna prepare for a Presidential reception, the Skedar assault the Carrington Institute and capture Joanna. In space, aboard an alien spaceship on course to the Skedar homeworld, Joanna finds herself
          in
          a holding cell with Cassandra. Feeling that she has been used, Cassandra redeems herself by making a distraction and sacrificing herself, freeing Joanna and therefore giving herself a chance for revenge. With the help of Elvis, Joanna
          takes
          control of the spaceship and lands on the Skedar homeworld, where she ultimately defeats the Skedar leader, leaving the Skedar in disarray. The game ends with Elvis and Joanna leaving the planet just prior to an orbital bombardment from
          the
          Maian navy.[19]</p>

        <h4><a id="DevelopmentContent">Development</h4>
        <b>Concept and desgin</b>
        <p>
          Perfect Dark was developed by Rare and originally directed by Martin Hollis as a spiritual successor to the company's 1997 first-person shooter GoldenEye 007.[21][22] Shortly after GoldenEye 007 was released,[22] Rare was planning to work
          on a game based on the GoldenEye sequel Tomorrow Never Dies, but the company was outbid by Electronic Arts, which would release their video game adaptation in 1999.[23] The result did not affect the developers, who felt they had already
          spent too much time immersed in the James Bond universe.[23][24] Working titles for the game included "Covert Ops" and "Alien Intelligence" before the words "Perfect Dark" were decided on.[25] The word "Dark" was chosen for its
          association
          with the game's bleak focus on killing.[26] Hollis noted naming similarities to the 2006 first-person shooter Black by Criterion Games: "Game developers just like black, nihilism, dystopian futures, the number zero, infinity, spheres,
          perfection—all that kind of stuff."[26] The double slash symbol in the game's logo was inspired by the Japanese writing system,[27] while the bad grammar of the phrase "Perfect Dark" partially alludes to Hollis' affection for the way
          Japanese developers use English words in their own games and products.[24]</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <b>Production</b>
        <p>When production of the game started, the developers upgraded the GoldenEye 007 engine with new features and graphical enhancements such as real-time lighting and support for bigger environments and more textures.[28] According to Rare,
          only 30% of the original engine remained, providing a basic framework to construct levels and animate characters.[30] A new movement system was constructed, allowing players to fall off edges.[22] Other incremental improvements included
          better shattering glass effects, which would allow players to shoot out objects such as bottles of wine, and the inclusion of computer-controlled bots in multiplayer matches.[25] The artificial intelligence was improved so that opponents
          could "assess threats, work as a team and communicate with each other."[31] Opponents were given the ability to draw a secondary weapon when disarmed.[32] Death cries and more elaborate gore effects, which allow gunshots to disperse and
          stain enemies' blood onto nearby walls and objects, were also added.[33]</p>

          <p>In June 1998,Rare announced that their follow-up to GoldenEye 007 would appear as Nintendo's lead game at that year's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Atlanta, Georgia.[50] Originally intended to be released in summer 1999 and
            later
            in December 1999,[51][52][53] Perfect Dark was heavily trailed in video game magazines, with Nintendo Official Magazine predicting that it would be "the best shooting game this century".[54] A working version of the game appeared at the
            European Computer Trade Show in September 1998;[55] N64 Magazine described the preview as having "the kind of attention to detail that had everyone who saw [it] drooling".[56] A more complete version was presented at E3 in May 1999, where
            the game's compatibility with the Game Boy Camera was announced,[57] and at Nintendo Spaceworld in August 1999, alongside Rare's Donkey Kong 64 and Jet Force Gemini.[58] Shortly before release, Rare unveiled a website for the in-game
            company dataDyne to promote interest in the game's storyline.[59][60]

            Perfect Dark was first released in North America on 22 May 2000.[33] Nintendo arranged a number of publicity stunts, including hiring model Michele Merkin, who appeared as Joanna Dark in commercials and in-store promotions for the
            game.[61][62] The game received a Mature rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board, particularly for its graphic content and adult language.[33] This generated some controversy because Nintendo has a reputation for
            family-friendly
            games.[63] The European release followed on 30 June 2000.[9] To supplement the game, Rare released a Game Boy Color counterpart, also titled Perfect Dark, shortly afterwards.[64] The Game Boy Color game features a compatibility mode that
            allows certain cheats within the Nintendo 64 game to alternatively be unlocked via the Transfer Pak.[65] In Japan, Perfect Dark was released on 21 October 2000.[66]

            Perfect Dark features a different box art for each regional release.[67] Rare's art director Kev Bayliss, who created the North American and European artworks, designed the North American version in one day because Rare needed it very
            quickly.[67] He then created a more suitable Joanna Dark model for the European version and all the promotional material at the time.[67] For the Japanese release, a completely different image was requested by Nintendo,[67] who originally
            considered releasing the game in Japan under the title "Aka to Kuro" (赤と黒, lit. "Red and Black").[68] "Perfect Dark" does not translate well into Japanese, and the title "Aka to Kuro" was considered sufficiently edgy.[69] However, the
            game
            was ultimately released as パーフェクト・ダーク (Pāfekuto Dāku), a transliteration of the Western title.[70]

            According to NPD's Toy Retail Survey Tracking system, Perfect Dark was the second best-selling game of May 2000 in North America, behind Pokémon Trading Card Game.[71] The Japanese launch saw sales totalling 35,000 units in its first
            week.[66] As a bestseller, Perfect Dark joined Nintendo's "Player's Choice" game selection on 21 December 2000.[72] The game sold relatively well through the year's holiday season, reaching No. 23 on the all formats chart for the week of
            24
            December 2000.[73] As of March 2003, Perfect Dark had sold almost 1.3 million copies in the United States and 77,000 copies in Japan.[66] Total sales in the United States reached 1.5 million by December 2007.[74] In a 2011 interview with
            Eurogamer, game designer Chris Tilston revealed that lifetime sales for the game reached 3.2 million, but did not clarify if the figure accounted for units shipped to retailers.[75]</p>

            Perfect Dark has been featured in many "greatest game" lists. In 2006 the game placed 15th on IGN's "Readers Choice Top 100 Games Ever" list; also that year it was rated the 100th best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Power. In 2007 it placed 28th in Edge (magazine) "100 Best Videogames" special issue (a list voted for by readers, Edge staff and gaming industry professionals). Retrieved 28 December 2008.

            Rare was also recognized for its work on the game, as the company was awarded the Bafta Interactive Entertainment Moving Images Award for 2000 and the Golden Satellite Award for Best Interactive Product in 2001.

          Upon release, Perfect Dark received critical acclaim from video game publications.[77] The most praised aspects of the game were its graphics, artificial intelligence, and number of multiplayer options.[1][15][9][79] GameSpot claimed that,
          as a console first-person shooter, Perfect Dark is "unparalleled",[15] while IGN journalist Matt Casamassina remarked that its extensive features set the game apart from its peers.[1] Similarly, N64 Magazine described Perfect Dark as
          "dauntingly huge", stating that it "takes everything that made its predecessor such an enduring favourite and does it bigger, better and more often."[3] Edge concluded that, although the game fails to be as revolutionary as its predecessor,
          it refines its "phenomenal gameplay while massively developing its multiplayer components."[9] Nintendo Power editors called the game "undeniably a work of art", suspenseful, "more compelling than most action movies and much deeper than any
          video game of its type."[82]

          The graphics were praised for their dynamic lighting, complex geometry, varied textures, and smooth animations.[1][78][13][83] IGN remarked that levels were more detailed than in GoldenEye 007, and that character models and weapons were
          "wonderfully" animated.[1] GameRevolution highlighted the game's semi-realistic look, saying that it "adds to the depth and addiction of the game".[81] The game's voiced cutscenes, surround sound effects, and atmospheric score, which was
          described as a mixture between the Blade Runner soundtrack by Vangelis and GoldenEye 007's, were said to effectively bring the game to life.[1][82][80][3] The Electric Playground credited Rare for being able to fit such a clear sounding
          experience into the limited space of a Nintendo 64 cartridge.[83]

          The gameplay was praised for the challenging artificial intelligence of enemies and varied level design.[15][9][13] The enemies were admired for their use of squad tactics, ability to wait for players to come back instead of obediently
          chasing after them, and for ducking around a corner for cover.[15] As with GoldenEye 007, the game's nonlinear approach to completing mission objectives was highlighted positively, giving players freedom to deal with situations as they see
          fit.[9] The multiplayer mode was seen as the strongest aspect of the game. Reviewers noted that the flexibility of options, number of gameplay modes, "clever" weapons, number of unlockable features, and customisable computer-controlled bots
          give the game an unprecedented amount of replay value.[15][1][79][81][83] GamePro called the game's Counter-Operative mode one of the "coolest multiplayer modes ever", stating that the player playing as Joanna never knows which enemy the
          opposing player controls.[80]

          The most frequently criticised aspect of the game was its inconsistent frame rate.[79][13][9][15][83] According to Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, the game's "inadequate temporal resolution—owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege
          visual detail over frame-rate—made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels."[84] IGN observed that the frame rate can be "sluggish in certain wide-open areas or when there are lots of enemies on-screen, but for some odd reason it's never
          really bothersome. Most of the time you're so caught up in the game that you don't notice it, and when you do, you're willing to forgive it as Perfect Dark is just too much fun to dwell on such an issue".[1] Poole also described the "lazy
          sci-fi fetishism" of Joanna Dark's character design as "a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft",[84] and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a
          problem that GoldenEye 007 had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond.[85]

          At their Best and Worst of 2000 awards, GameSpot editors awarded Perfect Dark Best Nintendo 64 Game and Best Shooting Game.[86][87] Rare was also recognised for its work on the game and received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Moving
          Images Award for 2000,[88] and the Golden Satellite Award for Best Interactive Product in 2001.[89]</p>
          Perfect Dark has been featured in many "greatest game" lists. In 2006 the game placed 15th on IGN's "Readers Choice Top 100 Games Ever" list; also that year it was rated the 100th best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Power.

          Shortly after Perfect Dark was released, Rare planned to develop a "sister" title, called Velvet Dark, for either the Nintendo 64 or the Nintendo 64's successor, the GameCube, but the project was ultimately abandoned.[90] The name "Velvet
          Dark" references Joanna Dark's alleged sister, who is the character players assume the role of in the game's co-operative mode.[90] Meanwhile, Free Radical Design released TimeSplitters for the PlayStation 2 in October 2000, a first-person
          shooter based around a completely new engine.[91] TimeSplitters bears several gameplay and presentational similarities to GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark, including a similar aiming system and unlockable options through quick level
          completions.[92][91] After Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002,[93] the company released a prequel, Perfect Dark Zero, as a launch title for the Xbox 360 in 2005. Although the game received generally positive reviews from critics,[94]
          some publications felt it did not meet their expectations.[95][96]

          In a retrospective analysis, Edge acknowledged that the game's frame rate and other dated elements of its design rendered it "nigh-on unplayable".[97] The magazine found the ambitious mentality which resulted in weapons and
          computer-controlled players being "designed for possibilities rather than balance", both one of Perfect Dark's most interesting aspects and the cause of its biggest problem: "Restraint [...] would have made Perfect Dark a tighter, more
          focused experience, helped with those framerate issues, and removed almost all of the fun."[97] The magazine concluded that despite Perfect Dark not standing up as a good game to play in 2009, "its currency of ideas and provocation [...]
          remains sound."[97] In 2015, Den of Geek considered Perfect Dark "a game that's done more for the shooter genre than often credited for", and stated that the game was still ahead of time because no game had revitalised its ideas.[98]

          Since its release, the game has attracted a following of elite players who constantly try to speedrun its levels and break world records.[99] These records are managed by their website and involve highly skilled players exploiting tiny
          gameplay inconsistencies.[99][100] The game is occasionally cited as one of the greatest video games of all time by some publications. In 2006, Perfect Dark was placed at No. 15 on IGN's Readers Choice Top 100 Games Ever,[101] while
          Nintendo Power included it in their list of Top 200 Nintendo games.[102] In 2007, IGN editors placed the game at No. 86 on their list of Top 100 Games of All Time, noting that "Everything that GoldenEye made great, Perfect Dark did too, and
          then some."[103] Similarly, Edge placed the title at No. 28 on their 2007 list of 100 Best Videogames (a list voted for by readers, Edge staff and gaming industry professionals).[104] The magazine claimed that the game brought the Nintendo
          64 era to a satisfying close.[104]
          On March 17th, 2010, Rare released a HD remaster of Perfect Dark for Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade, featuring the original game with more detailed textures (in 1080p), and, of course, 60 FPS gameplay. It was originally available for purchase for 800 Microsoft Points, but now must be purchased for 10$ USD, as Microsoft Points were discontinued in August 2013. It features new control options that are relatively easy to adapt to, with button layouts like Halo and Call of Duty (named Spartan and Duty Calls respectfully). Cycling through weapons also became easier, as bi-directional cycling was added to the remaster

          Main article: Perfect Dark (2010 video game)
          A remaster of the game, also titled Perfect Dark, was released in 2010 for the Xbox 360 through its Xbox Live Arcade download service, featuring improved frame rate, enhanced graphics and an online multiplayer.[105] The remaster was
          developed by 4J Studios, the same studio that previously handled the Xbox 360 ports of Rare's platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie.[106] The game received generally favorable reviews from gaming publications. Some critics considered
          the relatively unchanged game to be outdated, but most agreed that the title was a solid revival of a classic.[107][105] In 2015, the remaster was included in the Rare Replay video game compilation for Xbox One.[108]
