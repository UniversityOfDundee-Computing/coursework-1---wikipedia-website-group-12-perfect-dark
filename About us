                <p> Rare, Ltd. (formerly known as Rareware) is a British video game development company and the company who  developed the Perfect Dark series of games.
Rare was founded in 1982 by brothers Tim and Chris Stamper as Ashby Computers and Graphics Ltd.

 (ACG). Publishing as Ultimate Play the Game, they developed games for 8-bit platforms such as the ZX Spectrum, the Commodore 64 and the BBC Micro, before the name was sold to U.S.

 Gold in 1985. In 1994, Rare entered an exclusive publishing agreement for Nintendo gaming consoles. In 2002, Rare was acquired by Microsoft. However, many employees broke off from Rare to form their own companies. One such company was Free Radical Design, which created the Time Splitters Series which shared many design elements with Goldeneye 007 and Perfect Dark. However, Free Radical Design was aquired by Crytek in 2009.
