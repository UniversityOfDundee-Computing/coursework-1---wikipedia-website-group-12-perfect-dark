        <td>Thank you for your interest in contacting Wikipedia. Before proceeding, some important disclaimers:

          Wikipedia has no central editorial board. Contributions are made by a large number of volunteers at their own discretion. Edits are neither the responsibility of the Wikimedia Foundation (the organisation that hosts the site) nor of its
          staff and edits will not generally be made in response to an email request.
          Although Wikipedia was founded by Jimmy Wales, he is not personally responsible for our content.
          If you have questions about the concept of Wikipedia rather than a specific problem, the About Wikipedia page may help.
          If you want to ask other users for help with editing or using Wikipedia, stop by the Teahouse, Wikipedia's live help channel, or the help desk to ask someone for assistance.
          If you disagree with an article's content, or are involved in a content dispute, see Dispute resolution.
          The links on the left should direct you to how to contact us or resolve problems. If you cannot find your issue listed there, you can email helpful, experienced volunteers at info-en@wikimedia.org. Please refrain from emailing about
          disagreements with content; they will not be resolved via email.

          Wikipedia is written almost exclusively by volunteers â€” people from across the world, just like you. This means that sometimes it contains incorrect information, either accidentally or deliberately.

          If you find some incorrect information, there are a few things you can do.

          First, you can fix it yourself! Anyone can edit Wikipedia. Just hit the "edit" button on the top right of the page, make the correction, and hit "Publish changes". If you want to learn more about editing, try our help pages.
          If you can't or don't want to fix an error, your best approach is to leave a note at the talk page of the article explaining the problem.
          For vandalism, it is best just to fix it directly yourself; however, if you cannot fix it, you can email info-en-v@wikimedia.org and include the address or title of the article and a description of the vandalism.
          You can also email the Wikipedia Volunteer Response Team at info-en-o@wikimedia.org, although we may not be able to assist with all suggestions. That list is managed by a small group of volunteers. If you do email, please include the
          address or title of the article and a description of the issue. Note that this volunteer team cannot assist you in writing entirely new articles, answering questions about things not found on Wikipedia, or resolving disputes about content.
          If we don't have an article on what you're looking for, you can add it to the list of requested articles. This unfortunately doesn't necessarily mean that it will be written immediately, or ever. If we do have an article but it doesn't
          include what you were looking for, or you just want the answer to a specific question, you can ask at the reference desk: our volunteers are always happy to help!

        If you believe an article about you or your organization is incomplete, inaccurate, or biased, there are several avenues for you to discuss the issue with Wikipedia's editorial community.


        Location of the talk page tab
        Wikipedia does not have a centralised author or content reviewer, and our content is maintained by volunteer editors. The people who have edited or who monitor your article are probably the best first point of contact.

        People who edit or monitor your article can be reached by leaving a note detailing your issues on the article's "talk" page. This can be found by clicking the "talk" link at the top of your article. Once you're there, click the "new
        section" tab to the right of that. This will create a new section, where you can post your specific comments or concerns - put {{request edit}} at the top of your new section to indicate your conflict of interest and ask for the edits to be
        done for you. Click "Publish page", and your new section will be added immediately.

        If leaving a message on the talk page does not help, you can leave a message at the help desk, which is more frequently monitored.

        Alternatively, you can reach other experienced volunteers by emailing info-en-q@wikimedia.org . Please include the address or title of your article and specific information on the problems you have with it. While your email will likely
        remain confidential, certain unforeseen circumstances, including but not limited to security breaches, subpoenas, or leaks, might compromise that confidentiality. Note that while volunteers may assist you in removing very bad data, they
        will not add new data for you - for such edits you need to use the talk page as described above.

        If you're interested in donating photographs to illustrate your article or adding a recording of your voice, you can upload them yourself and include them in the article. Alternatively, you can email photosubmission@wikimedia.org . Please
        include the photograph in question, along with a statement that you own the copyright on it, and an agreement to release it under a free license. Our recommended license is the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license. If you
        don't own the copyright, please ask the photographer or copyright owner to send in a release instead. The "declaration of consent" may be used if desired.

        Do you want to use something you've found on Wikipedia? Wikipedia is a freely licensed encyclopedia; most of our content can be copied and used for any purpose. The exception to this is content used as "fair use". Fair use media is clearly
        identified if you go to the page about that file; you should see that the file is identified as "fair use under United States copyright law. Other uses of this image, on Wikipedia or elsewhere, might be copyright infringement" in the
        "Licensing" section. Fair use text should be marked explicitly as a quotation. All other content should be freely licensed and open for your use as long as you meet the licensing conditions. For specifics, see our page on reusing Wikipedia
        content. We try hard to identify the sources and licenses of all media such as text, images or sounds used in our encyclopedia articles. Still, we cannot guarantee that all media are used or marked correctly. If an image description page
        states that an image was in the public domain, you should still check yourself whether that claim appears correct and decide for yourself whether your use of the image would be acceptable under the laws applicable to you.

        Are you concerned that something you've found here is in breach of copyright? If you're worried that we're using your copyrighted works improperly, you can email us at info-en-c@wikimedia.org . Please provide the address or title of the
        page, and evidence to show that you are the legitimate copyright holder. If you prefer to use the formal OCILLA request, your DMCA takedown request must be sent to our designated agent. If you are not the copyright holder, we still welcome
        the information. See Wikipedia:Copyvio101 for how to flag the issue; alternatively, you can also use the email address above.

        You can also donate content, such as photographs, to Wikipedia. You can upload it yourself and then include it in the article, or you can email it to photosubmission@wikimedia.org . If you choose to email the content, please include the
        photograph in question, along with a statement that you own the copyright on it and an agreement to release it under a free license. Our recommended license is the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license. The form at
        Wikipedia:Declaration of consent can be used for this purpose. Please note that submissions made by email may take several weeks to process. Finally, if the content you wish to donate is already online, you can submit a request that another
        user upload it for you. For more information about donating your copyrighted content, see Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials.

        Wikipedia and its fellow sites are hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organisation based in the United States. Sites like Google or Yahoo are hosted on thousands of servers, with thousands of employees; we have around 800
        servers and around 350 staff, and cover our costs through donationsâ€”almost all from members of the public.
